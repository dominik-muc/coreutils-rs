# coreutils-rs

This repository is a rewrite of GNU's coreutils. Mostly for educational purposes, but you can also use it as a drop-in replacement. It is currently work-in-progress, and may not be finished fully ever.

If you know how to make things better than me, please reach out to me through PR, I would really appreciate that.
